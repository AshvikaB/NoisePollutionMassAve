# Noise Pollution MassAve

## Description : 
Collaborative project that aimed to understand the impact of noise pollution in the Mass Ave community. Three primary tasks for were developed to quantify the negative impact of cars on air and noise pollution and convince members of the Mass Ave community to protect their homes and health by choosing greener modes of transportation. The first task was to examine the effect that fluctuations in the prevalence of various types of commutes have on air quality in Boston. The second task was to investigate the portion of noise pollution created by automobiles in various neighborhoods surrounding Mass Ave. The last task of this project was to quantify the impact of vehicles on the pollution of streetscapes within Mass Ave communities.

The second task created an interactive map to show the noise complaints caused by automobiles (circular marks) and the average PM 2.5 levels (square marks) in three areas in Suffolk County. The 
user is able to hover over gray areas to display the Boston neighborhood name. The noise complaint points display locations of noise complaints related to automobiles. Hovering over each point shows the street name where the noise complaint was filed. The legend is interactive; when the user clicks on a specific year, noise complaints from that specific year are shown. When hovering over the square marks (locations of PM 2.5 
monitors), a bar graph appears; the bar graph shows the average PM 2.5 levels for 2019, 2020, and 2021 in the area the user hovered over. This was done through 
the Altair library in Python.
